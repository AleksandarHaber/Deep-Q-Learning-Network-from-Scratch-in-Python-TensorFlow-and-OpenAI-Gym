# Deep-Q-Learning-Network-from-Scratch-in-Python-TensorFlow-and-OpenAI-Gym

These code files implement the Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) algorithm from scratch by using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenAI Gym. The codes are tested in the OpenAI Gym Cart Pole (v1) environment. These code files are a part of the reinforcement learning tutorial I am developing. The tutorial webpage explaining the codes is given here:
